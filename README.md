### Numerical Methods http://eisc.correounivalle.edu.co/

#### Introduction

This is the repository of source code for the practices of the numerical methods course. In this course students learn about the principles for solving problems using numerical methods techniques and how to implement them using the software scilab 
 
The following topics are study in the course:
* [Round and Truncation Errors] 
(https://github.com/UNIVALLE-EISC/numerical-methods/tree/master/scilab_code/01_errors/scilab)
* [Root Finding]
(https://github.com/UNIVALLE-EISC/numerical-methods/tree/master/scilab_code/02_root_finding/scilab)
* [Optimization]
(https://github.com/UNIVALLE-EISC/numerical-methods/tree/master/scilab_code/03_optimization/scilab)
* Linear and Non Linear Systems
* Regression and Interpolation
* Numerical derivation and integration
* Ordinary Equations
